=== Renaming a column in backward-incompatible way

Let's take a look at the following example if you want to change the column name:

WARNING: The following example is deliberately done in such a way that it will break. We're showing it to depict the problem of database
compatibility.

Version of the app: `2.0.0.BAD`

Version of the DB: `v2bad`

==== Comment

Current changes DO NOT allow us to run two instances (old and new) at the same time. Thus zero down time
deployment will be difficult to achieve (if we take into consideration our assumptions it's actually impossible).

===== A/B testing

The current situation is that we have an app deployed to production in version `1.0.0` and db in `v1`. We want to deploy the second
instance of the app that will be in version `2.0.0.BAD` and update the db to `v2bad`.

Steps:

. a new instance is deployed in version `2.0.0.BAD` that updates the db to `v2bad`
. in `v2bad` of the database the column `last_name` is no longer existing - it got changed to `surname`
. the db and app upgrade is successful and you have some instances working in `1.0.0`, others in `2.0.0.BAD`. All are talking to db
in `v2bad`
. all instances of version `1.0.0` will start producing exceptions cause they will try to insert data to `last_name` column which is
no longer there
. all instances of version `2.0.0.BAD` will work without any issues

As you can see if we do backward incompatible changes of the DB and the application, A/B testing is impossible.

===== Rolling back the application

Let's assume that after trying to do A/B deployment we've decided that we need to rollback the app back to version `1.0.0`. We assumed
that we don't want to roll back the database.

Steps:

. we shut down the instance that was running with version `2.0.0.BAD`
. the database is still in `v2bad`
. since version `1.0.0` doesn't understand what `surname` column is it will produce exceptions
. hell broke loose and we can't go back

As you can see if we do backward incompatible changes of the DB and the application, we can't roll back to a previous version.

Backward incompatible scenario:

01) Run 1.0.0
02) Wait for the app (1.0.0) to boot
03) Generate a person by calling POST localhost:9991/person to version 1.0.0
04) Run 2.0.0.BAD
05) Wait for the app (2.0.0.BAD) to boot
06) Generate a person by calling POST localhost:9991/person to version 1.0.0 <-- this should fail
07) Generate a person by calling POST localhost:9992/person to version 2.0.0.BAD <-- this should pass

==== DB changes

The migration script renames the column from `last_name` to `surname`

==== Code changes

We have changed the field name from `lastName` to `surname`.
