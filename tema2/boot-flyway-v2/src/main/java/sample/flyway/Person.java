	 * the surname column is not up to date (during the migration process lastName could have been updated).
	 * In this case one can run yet another migration script after all applications have been deployed in the
	 * new version to ensure that the surname field is updated.
	 *
	 * However it makes sense since when looking at the migration from 2.0.0 -> 3.0.0. In 3.0.0 we no longer
	 * have a notion of lastName at all - so we don't update that column. If we rollback from 3.0.0 -> 2.0.0 if we
	 * would be reading from lastName, then we would have very old data (since not a single datum was inserted
	 * to lastName in version 3.0.0).
