=== Step 2: Adding surname

Version of the app: `2.0.0`

Version of the DB: `v2`

==== Comment

By adding a new column and copying its contents we have created backward compatible changes of the db. ATM if we
rollback the JAR / have an old JAR working at the same tame it won't break at runtime.

===== Rolling a new version

Steps:

. migrate your db to create the new column called `surname`. Now your db is in `v2`
. copy the data from the `last_name` column to `surname`. *NOTE* that if you have a lot of this data then you should consider batch
migration!
. write the code to use *BOTH* the *new* and the *old* column. Now your app is in version `2.0.0`
. read the surname value from `surname` column if it's not null and from `last_name` if `surname` wasn't set.
You can remove the `getLastName()` from the code since it will produce nulls when your app is rolled back from `3.0.0` to `2.0.0`.

If you're using Spring Boot Flyway first two steps will be performed upon booting the version `2.0.0` of the app.  If you're running
database versioning tool manually then you'd have to do it in separate processes (first manually upgrade the db version and then deploy
the new app).

IMPORTANT: Remember that the newly created column *MUST NOT* be *NOT NULL*. If you rollback, the old app has no knowledge of the new
column and won't set it upon `Insert`. But if you add that constraint and your db is in `v2` it would require the value of the new
column to be set. That would result in constraint violations.

IMPORTANT: You should remove the `getLastName()` method because in version `3.0.0` there is no notion of `last_name` column in the code.
 That means that nulls will be set there. You can leave the method and add null-checks but a much better solution would be to ensure
 that in the logic of `getSurname()` you pick the proper, non-null value.

===== A/B testing

The current situation is that we have an app deployed to production in version `1.0.0` and db in `v1`. We want to deploy the second
instance of the app that will be in version `2.0.0` and update the db to `v2`.

Steps:

. a new instance is deployed in version `2.0.0` that updates the db to `v2`
. in the meantime some requests got processed by instances being in version `1.0.0`
. the upgrade is successful and you have some instances working in `1.0.0`, others in `2.0.0`. All are talking to db in `v2`
. version `1.0.0` is not using the database's column `surname` and version `2.0.0` is. They don't interfere with each other, no exceptions
should be thrown.
. version `2.0.0` is saving data to both old and new column thus it's backward compatible

IMPORTANT: If you have any queries that count items basing on values from old / new column you have to remember that now you have
duplicate values (most likely still being migrated). E.g. if you want to count the number of users whose last name (however you call it)
starts with a letter `A` then until the data migration (`old` -> `new` column) is done you might have inconsistent data if you
perform the query against the new column.

===== Rolling back the application

The current situation is that we have app in version `2.0.0` and db in `v2`.

Steps:

. roll back your app to version `1.0.0`.
. version `1.0.0` is not using the database's column `surname` thus rollback should be successful

==== DB changes

The db contains a column called `last_name`.

Initial Flyway script:

[source,sql,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__init.sql[]
----

Script adding `surname` column.

WARNING: Remember NOT TO ADD any NOT NULL constraints to the added column. Cause if you rollback the JAR
 the old version doesn't have the notion of the added column and automatically a NULL value will be set. In case
 of having a constraint the old application will blow up.

[source,sql,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/resources/db/migration/V2__Add_surname.sql[]
----

==== Code changes

We are storing data in both `last_name` and `surname`. Also, we are reading from the `last_name` column cause
it is most up to date. During the deployment process some requests might have been processed by the instance that
hasn't yet been upgraded.
